 GitHubGraphData.py => This file contains python code that gathers specific information on a given user and I then display it in a D3 graph, specifically a force collapsible graph.
 The GitHub user account I have chosen to gather info on is "NYCSwan". The graph displays all NYCSwan's followers. You are then able to see all the repos of each follower. You can then click on each repo and it will
 display all the files in each repo.
 
 GitHubGraph.HTML => This file contains the HTML code that produces the force collapsible graph that display all the github users data.
 
 Data.json => This file contains all the data that was gathered from the GitHubGraphData.py file all in a json file. This json data is then used in the GitHubGraph.HTML file.
